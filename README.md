Project Code for Honours Project "System Equivalent Flux Density of a Lunar Orbiting Radio Interferometer" by Caleb Crouch

The program is written in python, the required packages for the project can be found in declarations at the top of the code. The code is provided as a python file and as a Jupyter Notebook file.
Intructions for using the program can be found in the main function at the start of the program.

This program has been uploaded to gethub as part of my honours project submission for Curtin University in Western Australia. The project is not actively being worked on or monitored.
